# How to set up and run prototype:

1. Download code into local machine
2. In a terminal, navigate to root directory of the project and run 'node server.js'
3. In a separate terminal, from the root directory, navigate to \frontend\materials-insight and run 'npm start' which opens the local app
4. Select alloy to inquire about, inquiry type, and then enter your inquiry


Deployed app can be found here: http://materials-435923.appspot.com/
